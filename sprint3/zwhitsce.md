# Sprint 3

Zackery Whitscell | zwhitsce | RecurseAI

### What you planned to do

- Implement a button to scroll to the bottom of the chat dialog
- Edit the README.md to follow the guidelines provided in lecture
- Create a license for our software
- Help the other guys with their portions of the project, from database and backend to the formatting of the page
- Implement a button to automatically scroll to the bottom of the page
- Implement the recursive calling of the app to the API

### What you did not do

- I did not finish the recursive portion of the project as this task ended up being much larger than anticipated
- I did not finish with the README.md file yet as I still need to write the installation instructions

### What problems you encountered

- This style of development is still very new for me and thus I struggled a lot with all the technologies and tooling
- I had a project I needed to finish for my internship that took a large portion of my freetime
- I worked with the team better in this sprint but found I understand less of the overall project than I would have liked
- I found working between components and having to prompt certain aspects to be very difficult
- The whole recursive portion of our project appears to be quite overwhelming at this stage
