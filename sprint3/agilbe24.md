- `components/ChatPageNavbar/index.module.css`
### What you accomplished
Made it where once you select a chat in the navbar, once it takes you to that chat page, the chat button you selected stays highlighted to help give the user what chat they are in. Formated the header to make the chatpage look more organized. Formated the toggle navbar and settings button to match the theme with the rest of the website.
