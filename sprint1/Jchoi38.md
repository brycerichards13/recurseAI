### What you accomplished
I focused mainly on the frontend side of the website. I specifically worked on creating a
navigation bar for the front page that can be used. In addition to css styles for different
aspects of the page that can be reused for example, buttons. I made sure that the part I did
would look close to what the final design would be so that we wouldn't need to come back and
do more to stylize it later. In addition to that, I'm in charge of the website final designs
as I do a lot of the figma mockups of what each page might look like in the end product. This
is important so that we have a final design to work our frontend work based off of so that the frontend looks decent and we're not redoing the same work over each other.
