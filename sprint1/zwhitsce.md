# Sprint 1

Zackery Whitscell | zwhitsce | RecurseAI

### What you planned to do

- I planned to help design the user frontend and potential deisngs for the chat page and trees
- I also planned on working alongside Bryces code to bring in user data and call the API
- I planned on creating a React button to reprompt the AI if the user didn't like the resposne
- I planned to create a documentation link off the main page
- I planned to allow the user to go back and forth within a text branch

### What you did not do

- I couldn't get the database to work with the AI responses and thus could not commit half of my work
- As the database wasn't functioning I could not complete some the treeing, recursive part of the code

### What problems you encountered

- Using one components informatin in another
- Web development in general. Never having used these languages before
- Using server functions in a client side React component.

### Issues you worked on

[#3](https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall23/recurseAI/issues/3)\
[#4](https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall23/recurseAI/issues/4)\
[#5](https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall23/recurseAI/issues/5)

### Files you worked on

- `page.tsx`
- `app/chat_page/page.tsx`
- `app/documentation/page.tsx`
- `components/chat-box.tsx`
- `components/chat-input.tsx`
- `components/chat-response.ts`

### What you accomplished

First I helped plan and design the future UI of the application once it had been completed
I then helped create a documentation page that linked from the landing page and back
I followed this up once the initial chatbox was completed with creating a component to allow reprompting of the AI. This works as a React button that brings in user input from chat-input.tsx and repompting the AI
I finished by designing propping for the user input and the API repsosne so that we can store them in a database
