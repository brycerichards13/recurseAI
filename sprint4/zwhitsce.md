# Sprint 4

Zackery Whitscell | zwhitsce | RecurseAI

### What you planned to do

- Standardizing some of the code in the main chat page
- Provide support to necessary tasks that are behind schedule
- Write a branching code component
- Bug fix. Bug fix. Bug fix.
- Help formatting and finalizing the design.

### What you did not do

- The app is still not 100% bug free and the perfectionist in me hates that
- I did not get the branching prompts fully implemented. The inspiration was ChatGPTs prompts but this proved more challenging than expected

### What problems you encountered

- I am still very lost with the other guys and how their functions work into the mobile app.
- I found it hard to fix the bugs myself as my understanding of anything beyond the chat page is a little beyond me.
- I found the duplicated prompts and allowing the user to select their prefernce was much harder than anticipated.
- When attempting to integrate my branching functionality it broke the app and I had to `pull` the old `ChatInput`
- Time was a huge issue for me this spring. I started a fulltime job and working between finals, work, and this project was time management.

### What you accomplished

I discussed bugs and potential fixes
I researched new features and helped to develop an unreleased user choice prompt
I communicated with the team regarding next steps
I researched the componenets of the project that I dont understand and attempted to learn them as best as I could
I developed the groundwork of a new component to allow the user to see two prompts and select their favorite of the two to better tailor their experience.
