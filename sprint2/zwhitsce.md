# Sprint 2

Zackery Whitscell | zwhitsce | RecurseAI

### What you planned to do

- I planned to help Bryce with the chat-box and getting the chat outputs into the database
- I planned to implent a chat history that is scrollable and accessible
- I planned to fix my regenerate button from the first sprint to better work and be correct
- I planned to create a 404 error page
- I planned to help implement error checking on input strings
- I planned to fix the 'Go back' and 'Go forward' buttons once the database was established

### What you did not do

- I did not fully implement a scrollable chat history.
- I did not fully fix the chat page to my liking.
- I did not fix the 'Go back' and 'Go forward' buttons between prompts

### What problems you encountered

- Still a huge learning curve with everything importing new technologies and implementations
- Trying to make all the technologies work together was challenging
- I struggled with time management with my life outside of class
- I hoped for more colloboration between the team members but found myself working alone due to my lack of reaching out
