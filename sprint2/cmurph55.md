### What you planned to do

- Set up user structure and relevant relationships. [#36](https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall23/recurseAI/issues/36)
- Create the GET functions for retrieving data from the db. [#37](https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall23/recurseAI/issues/37)
- Create feature to add chats to the chat and read existing chats. [#38](https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall23/recurseAI/issues/38)
- Read and write messages and versionsOfMessage based on current chat. [#39](https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall23/recurseAI/issues/39)

### What you did not do

I was unable to finish issue 39 because I underestimated the amount of work that it entailed.

### What problems you encountered

- I still had the problem with my PC where it does not register certain client-side functions in any of my browsers, but I just got a new PC to use.

### What you accomplished

I created the backend scripts for user creation and creating the relationship between chats. I then created the GET function for the data. After that, I created dynamic routing for the chat page and then implemented the chat read and write functionality inside the page.
