### What you accomplished
I success formated two good looking buttons for refresh and create new chat. I include and downloaded a new package that allows 
for us to add symbols when we format. This adds for cool of customatization and formatting for buttons. I also formatted the different
chat buttons when you click the new chat button. I also made the the box were you type bigger and wider and better position on the screen.
