### What you planned to do
- [32](https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall23/recurseAI/issues/32) formatting the documentation page
- [33](https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall23/recurseAI/issues/33) finishing up the landing page
- [35](https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall23/recurseAI/issues/35) starting to format the chat page 
    - specifically the chat boxes on the chat
### What you did not do
- did not completely format the chat boxes though got some progress and found bugs

### What problems you encountered
- One problem was handling how everything is organized. Currently we're able to work on components individually that is then added to the main pages, however when someone else needs to modify their code, its difficult to figure out how exactly the previous person setup the code to work. it gets confusing at points because we're not really using branches.

### Issues you worked on
- [#32 Format Documentation Page](https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall23/recurseAI/issues/32)
- [#33 Landing Page Background and reformatting](https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall23/recurseAI/issues/33) 
- [#35 Development on Chat Page Chat Boxes](https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall23/recurseAI/issues/35) 

### Files you worked on
- components/chat-response.tsx
- components/ChatResponse/index.tsx
- components/markdown.jsx
- components/Markdown/index.tsx 
- components/Markdown/index.module.css
- components/chat-page-navbar.tsx
- components/navbar.module.css
- components/chat-input.tsx
- components/landing-page-navbar.tsx
- app/chat/page.module.css
- docs/next.md


### What you accomplished
the landing page now has a gradient background, and the documentation page is now formatted so that markdown pages are displayed onto the page correctly. The chat pages chat boxes are being developed and some bugs were found and the general components in the chat page are layed out for the most part.

#### P.S.
I think the my commits.txt labels me as writing lines that I have not created from a glance 427-717 are lines that I do not recognize at the very least
